      <h1>I Am Not The Bouncer</h1>
      <p>I am not the bouncer. I am a computer programmer. Despite my size and appearance, I do not work security at this or any other establishment.</p>

      <h2>I Am Also Not a Bouncer at Any Other Club</h2>
      <p>This confusion persists across venues. To reiterate, I am not the bouncer at any other club either.  I do not hold the necessary security accreditation for the role.</p>

      <h2>I'm Not Allowed To Decide If You Can Come In</h2>
      <p>It is not my intention to speak in riddles.  If I say something like "I Can't Say If You Are Allowed To Come In, Mate", there is a good reason.  And that reason is that I am not the bouncer.</p>

      <h2>Please Don't Ask How I Transitioned From My Career As A Bouncer To A Computer Programmer, Because I Was Not Previously A Bouncer Either</h2>
      <p>I have never previously worked as a bouncer.  So I did not have a career change away from being a bouncer to become a programmer.  Nor am I undergoing a training process where, for example, I work a bouncer while I study Computer Science at univerity.</p>

      <h2>Some Bars Do Not Have Security On The Door So It Is Possible That No-One Here Is The Bouncer Either, But Particularly Not Me</h2>
      <p>Only bars that open late typically have security on the door.  If you've encountered me before 10pm, it's very possible that no-one at this bar is the bouncer.  But I draw particular attention to the issue that I am not the bouncer.</p>

      <h2>The Transoccupational Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I am so regularly mistaken for the bouncer that I wondered if something deeper is going on.  I have a neologism to explain my situation: <strong>transoccupational</strong>.
        I am not the bouncer, but I am regularly mistaken for one.  This is the transoccupational experience.
