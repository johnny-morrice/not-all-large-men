            <h2>I Am Not A Bouncer At Any Other Establishment Either</h2>
            <p>I do not hold the necessary security accreditation for the role of Door Supervisor. I do not work here,
                or at any other licensed establishments.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>I Was Not Previously A Bouncer</h2>
            <p>There is no career change going on here. Nor am I undergoing a training process where I work as a bouncer
                on the weekends while I study to become a programmer.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>I'm Not Allowed To Decide If You Can Come In</h2>
            <p>It is not my intention to speak in riddles. If I say something like <i>"I can't tell you if you're
                    allowed to come in or not"</i>, there is a good reason for it.</p>
            <p>And that reason is because I am not the bouncer.</p>

            <h2>The Transoccupational Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have been wondering if something deeper is going on. I am so regularly mistaken for door security, and
                in situations where I am nowhere near the door of a venue, that I have adopted a word to explain my
                situation: <strong>transoccupational</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Members of the public project an occupational identity upon me, and when this happens it is very
                difficult to persuade them that
                they are mistaken.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the <strong>transoccupational experience</strong>.
            </p>
